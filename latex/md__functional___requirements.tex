The system shall allow the parking attendant to register a new vehicle entry by entering the license plate number and the current timestamp, only if the total number of vehicles in the garage is less than 100.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reason\+:}} To handle new entries and respect the garage’s capacity.
\item {\bfseries{Testable\+:}} Yes, by simulating a full garage and checking that entry is denied.

The system shall allow the parking attendant to manually log a vehicle’s exit by entering the license plate and current timestamp. The system shall calculate the fee as €2 per full or partial hour and update the vehicle record accordingly.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reason\+:}} To compute correct fees and allow exit tracking.
\item {\bfseries{Testable\+:}} Yes, by providing entry/exit times and verifying the calculated fee.

The system shall display the current number of vehicles inside the garage and list their license plates, when requested by the parking attendant.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reason\+:}} Enables attendants to know how many and which vehicles are currently inside.
\item {\bfseries{Testable\+:}} Yes, by asserting garage state after multiple entries/exits.

The system shall allow the parking attendant to update a previously logged entry or exit time for a vehicle, by entering the license plate number and the new timestamp.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reason\+:}} For error correction (e.\+g., wrong time input).
\item {\bfseries{Testable\+:}} Yes, by modifying and validating the corrected time and recalculated fee.

The system shall prevent new vehicle entries once the garage reaches 100 parked vehicles, and display an appropriate message to the parking attendant.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reason\+:}} To enforce the fixed garage capacity.
\item {\bfseries{Testable\+:}} Yes, by registering 100 entries and attempting a 101st.

At the end of the day, the system shall generate an output file that includes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a list of all cars that entered and exited,
\item the total number of cars served,
\item the total revenue,
\item and a list of cars that entered but did not exit before 22\+:00.
\item {\bfseries{Reason\+:}} For end-\/of-\/day reporting and accountability.
\item {\bfseries{Testable\+:}} Yes, by generating and parsing the output file.
